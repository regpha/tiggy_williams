                  <p class="lead" id="about_opening">My work is grounded in psychotherapeutic and counselling theory and research.</p>
                  <div id="about_content">
                    <p>I am fully qualified in Clinical Counselling with an MA from the University of Chester, accredited by the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). My first degree was taken at the University of Manchester and I have further training in Existential Therapy, Transactional Analysis, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Focusing, and an Advanced Post Diploma in Couples Counselling.</p>
                    <p>My experience comes from working within the private and public sector, both in the UK and abroad, having worked in the higher education sector, the NHS and a national mental health charity. I have a particular interest in working with creative high-achievers of all walks of life on issues ranging from depression and stress to narcisstic abuse.</p>
                    <p>As a member of the BACP I adhere to their Ethical Framework and am on the BACP register approved by the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care. I attend monthly supervision, hold professional insurance, an annually updated safeguarding certification and DBS. I take my continuous personal and professional development very seriously, attending further high quality training workshops and courses around the country.</p>
                    <p>I have lived and worked abroad for many years; from Spain to Japan, I have experienced life in other cultures and enjoy being challenged by differing perspectives. A single parent of two, I enjoy time spent with my children and friends, be it walking, gardening or travelling to other countries.</p>

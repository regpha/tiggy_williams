                <h4>Counselling and psychotherapy</h4>
                <p>As a humanistic integrative therapist, I work from the notion that no one can know your world better than you can. I believe that, when enabled through professional counselling, you can develop the resources and wisdom to know what is right for you to move forward.</p>
                <p>Working outside of labels and diagnosis, my role is to provide a warm and welcoming environment where you can share your troubles and feel supported, listened to and cared about. I tailor my sessions by focusing on your unique world views and personal experiences. My aim is to form a collaborative relationship that can help unravel and resolve your difficulties and worries.</p>
                <p>This counselling work can often be quite short term and for a specific issue. In a few sessions (8 -12), you may have the tools and self belief to move forwards with more confidence and control in your life.</p>
                <p>For those with more deep-seated problems or complex issues, longer term work may be required. Many people feel terrified or ashamed that they have a way of being in the world that has made life unbearable at times. Therapy can help towards developing a new understanding and increased self-awareness that will allow you to break free from destructive behaviours and feelings.</p>

                <h4>Relationship Counselling</h4>
                <p>For many couples, life together can become difficult at times. Whether it’s mid-life issues, dealing with empty nesting, caring for elderly relatives, unemployment, menopause, or working through infidelity… when faced with challenging issues, partners can suffer significantly destructive effects on their relationship and intimacy. Unaddressed stresses and conflict lead to non-stop bickering, a loss of trust or a break-down in communication that seem to persist without resolution.</p>
                <p>Relationship counselling can provide a confidential space where partners can come to talk about their problems without fear of judgement or embarrassment. Before deciding whether to be together or apart, counselling can help to get to the heart of your conflict and come to value each other’s beliefs and attitudes.</p>
                <p>Relationship counselling is not only about couples; it may be that you have challenges within the family that you would like to resolve by improving communication.</p>

                <h4>Adolescent Counselling</h4>
                <p>Our teenagers and young people are dealing with an ever- growing number of overwhelming challenges. Low self-esteem, exam pressure, bullying, crippling perfectionism, challenging home lives, a lack of self-confidence, eating disorders and destructive behaviours. Adolescents are faced with challenges that they are often unequipped to deal with. At such an important and vulnerable time in their lives, adolescents need to feel like there is a way of overcoming the onslaught of pressures, feelings and confusion that they carry with them.</p>
                <p>I work with young people to give them the tools and understanding they need to face these challenges and come out stronger on the other side. I believe in resilience borne out of self-awareness and open discussion, something that will help young people overcome the battles that they encounter on a day-to-day basis.</p>
